### Questions: 

- Does a continuous wetland to upland gradient exist? Or, can a catena-type model be derived using wetlands and uplands in a data-driven approach?
- If the ends of the wetland/upland classification are accurate, does the intermediate range correspond with hypothesized soil formation characteristics according to a hydropedological framework? 

Hydropedological units in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest include: 

- Drier more upland soils: Bhs, Typical
- Wetter soils: Bh, Histosol
- Intermediate/mesic soils: Bimodal, Inceptisol
